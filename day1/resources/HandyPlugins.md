# Reccomended Plugins

I like to have Black and Flake8 installed as plugins b/c now they are always running in a language server so they can do stuff like lint things before running commit hooks, and auto format with black on save.

1. Flake8 (ms-python.flake8): Helps you write clean code by checking for style violations and potential errors.
2. Black (ms-python.black-formatter): An opinionated code formatter that automatically formats your Python code to conform to PEP 8.

5. Jinja (wholroyd.jinja): Provides syntax highlighting and support for Jinja2 templates, which are often used in web development.
6. Jupyter (ms-toolsai.jupyter): Provides support for Jupyter notebooks, which are commonly used in data science and machine learning.
7. Python(ms-python.python): The official Python extension for Visual Studio Code, which provides support for Python development.
8. Markdown All in One (yzhang.markdown-all-in-one): A comprehensive Markdown extension that provides support for Markdown editing, previewing, and linting.
9. Markdownlint (DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint): A Markdown linter that helps you write clean and consistent Markdown documents.

11. Pylance (ms-toolsai.pylance): A fast and feature-rich language server for Python that provides type checking, code completion, and more.
12. Rainbow CSV (mechatroner.rainbow-csv): A CSV and TSV file viewer that provides syntax highlighting and support for editing CSV files.
13. Python Indent (kevinrose.vsc-python-indent): A Python indentation extension that helps you maintain consistent indentation in your Python code.
