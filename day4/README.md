# Day 4 - Hack away

Today's goal is for you to catch up on any loose ends from the previous days and to start working on your own primary improvement to the codebase. Here are a few suggestions:

**Suggestions**
- Add more models to the system evaluation
- Research and add another dataset to the system evaluation
- Add more metrics to the system evaluation
- Add another tool to the model
- Add a UI to the model, e.g. [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) or [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- Implement LLM-as-a-judge

## 1. Project Presentation

Please prepare a short presentation (5-10 minutes) of your project. This should include:
- A brief overview of your improvements
- Any interesting results from your improvements
- Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them
- Any additional features you would like to add

## 2. Rubric
